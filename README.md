SULFUR Lab is a fan-made, browser-based tool for players of SULFUR who want to plan, customize, and share their weapon builds. Design your ideal loadout by mixing attachments and enchantments, then generate a compact code to save or share with friends. Anyone can paste the code back into the builder to instantly recreate your setup—no login, no server, and everything runs securely in your browser.
